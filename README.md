------

.6dv stands for **6** **D**egree of freedom **V**ideo. 

.6dv was built from the ground up with a focus on streaming dynamic 3D generated content to standalone VR headsets that are limited in processing power. Volumetric Video takes up way too much bandwidth and requires expensive setups to create content. 6DV alleviates these issues by letting anyone with a computer livestream 3D scenes at less than 1/10 the bandwidth of the equivalent volumetric video to any standalone headset via webxr.

## General Structure
File is built out of this general structure, e.g. each one of these is bytes from start -> finish in the file:

File Signature (2 bytes) [uint16]: so that we now we're working with 6dv (see file signatures) 0xBEEF
Meta Size (4 bytes) [uint32]: The size of the metadata payload
Meta ByteString (meta_size bytes): A msgpack metadata object containing the info specified in Header Format
A series of repeating Frame Sequences. Each frame constitutes a contiguous block of bytes which can be read in as individual frames

## Header Format

| Property  | Num Bytes | Type | Notes |
| ------------- | ------------- | -------------| -------------|
| numFrames  | 4  | uint32 | All the frames in the file |
| fps  | 2  | uint16 | |




## Frame Sequence format
Each frame sequence has have the following structure:

1. Frame start marker (1 byte) [uint8]: This could be any unique random byte to just be like "hey, you're not crazy, this is where the frame starts"
1. Frame type (1 byte) [uint8]: 0 for IFrame and 1 for PFrame
1. Frame size (4 bytes) [uint32]: The size of all the frame bytes
1. Frame data (frame_size bytes): The actual frame data. This could either be:
    1. An IFrame, raw bytes from an glTF GLB file
    1. A PFrame, msgpack JSON diff object represented using the same encoding as the metadata header.
